# Why ARCs?

* Wallets and Dapps need to know how to view data
  * Standards make this easy to implement
* There are different use cases of ASAs and tokens
  * Different uses require different standards
* Native ASA fefatures is limited
  * Can be expanded with ARCs

# [ARC-0003](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003)

* General standard for displaying ASA information
* Uses off-chain JSON metadafile
  * Often stored on IPFS
* Defines standards for on-chain configuration fields
* Largely similar to ERC 1155 and Open Sea standards

---

# [ARC-0069](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0069)

* Uses note field for metadata
* Limitations
  * Metadata limited to 1KB due to note size limit
  * Indexer must be used to query asset config transaction
  * Image is immutable

---

# [ARC-0019](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0019)

* Uses reserve address field for point to IPFS metadata
* Metadata has no size restrictions
* Only algod is needed to get metadata
* Image is mutable
* Limitation
  * Can't use reserve address field as intended
---

# [ARC-0020](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0020)

* "Smart ASAs" via smart contract
* Can follow some existing ARCs, such as ARC3
* Allows more functionality than ASAs
  * Transfer logic
  * Mutability
* Should only be used when ASAs aren't an option
  * Smart contracts have much more security considerations

---

# ARC-0020 Interface

* Has ABI methods for performing same operations you can on ASAs
  * Create
  * Config
  * Freeze
  * Destroy
  * Transfer (and clawback)
* Adds the following methods ontop of ASAs
  * Asset Freeze vs Account Freeze
  * Get circulating supply

---

# [ARC-0018](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0018)

* Leverages ARC-0020 (smart contracts)
* On-chain royalty enforcement
  * Asset cannot be moved unless royalties are paid
  * OR the admin calls the royalty-free move function
* Enables royalties for payments in ALGO or ASAs
* Compatible with secondary marketplaces

# How to decide?
<style scoped>
  ul {
    font-size: 26px;
    position: relative;
    top: 5%
  }
</style>

* Start with ARC-0003
* Need mutability?
  * Need reserve address?
    * **Note:** reserve address has no affect at protocol level
    * ARC-0069
  * Otherwise
    * ARC-0019
* Need functionality ASAs don't provide?
  * Need enforced royalties on sales?
    * ARC-0018
  * Otherwise
    * ARC-0020
