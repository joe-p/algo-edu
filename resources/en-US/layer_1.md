# [Performance](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/#performance)

* ~3.7 second block time
* Instant finality
* 6,000 TPS
* .001 ALGO fee
* Low energy consumption

<!--
The average TPS right now is between 10-20 (for most chains, including Algorand). The fee is subject to increase under congestion
-->

# [Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)](https://www.algorand.com/technology#ALGORAND-STANDARD-ASSETS)

* User-created tokens that are primitive to the blockchain
* Allows easy creation of tokens without smart contract risk
  * Supports fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
* Features
  * Clawback: Allows a specified address to take back an asset
  * Freeze: Allows a specific address to freeze an asset
  * Metadata URL: Point to off-chain metadata for a token
  * Opt-in: Accounts must whitelist assets they wish to receive

---

# [Smart Contracts](https://www.algorand.com/technology#SMART-CONTRACTS-&-AVM)

* Flat fee until congestion
* Turing complete
  * Hard-coded limitations to keep complexity in check
* Can read/write blockchain state and send transactions

---

# [State Proofs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/stateproofs/)

* Attest to state of the chain in a verifiable way
* Can be leveraged by other chains for interoperability
  * Bridge on another chain can verify Algorand state proof on-chain
* Provides quantum security of chain history

---

# [Minimum balance requirement (MBR)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/#minimum-balance)

* Every account has a minimum balance
  * Starts at 0.1 ALGO
* Any transaction that would result in an account going under the MBR will fail
  * Exception is when an account makes an account to specifically close out the entire balance
* MBR is a way to rent space in the current state of the blockahin
  * Since ALGO is capped, the active state of the blockchain is also capped

# MBR Changes

| Action | Effect | Effect on MBR |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| Asset opt-in | account can receive the asset | increased by 0.1 ALGO |
| Application opt-in | application can save state to the account | increased proportional to data saved locally (see formula [here](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/apps/#minimum-balance-requirement-for-a-smart-contract)) |
| Application creation | application is created | increased proportional to data saved globally (see formula [here](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/apps/#minimum-balance-requirement-for-a-smart-contract)) |
| Asset opt-out | account can no longer hold or receive asset | decreased by 0.1 ALGO |
| Application opt-out | account's local state for the given application is cleared | decreased by same amount as opt-in |
| Application delete   | no one can interact with the app | decreased by same amount as creation |

# [Rekeying](https://www.algorand.com/technology#REKEYING)

* Allows a different private key to sign for a given address
* Once an account is rekeyed the original private key can no longer sign transactions
* Rekeying can be initiated with any regular transaction

---

# Atomic Transactions

* Algorand supports grouping 16 transactions together
  * If one transaction fails, they all fail
* Smart contracts can also send 16 transactions
  * Total of 256 atomic transactions
* Smart contracts can verify data of transactions in the same group
